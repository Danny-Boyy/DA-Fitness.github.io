<!--Place any ideas you think off as comments at the bottom of the index like this:

Create an easy method of creating an account -- it'll say at the bottom of the main page smth like 'join D&A today' or 'are you
new?', which will then have an input box just like the one in login.html but just the username/email box which they can enter
either to and then once enter or next is pressed, it will then ask for a password to create a password for their new account
similar to how gmail or microsoft works when you're tryna log into somewhere with google or microsoft / it asks for your email,
then slides you over the password screen and asks to press smth like 'continue'
